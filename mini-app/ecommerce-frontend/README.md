- Using the lint-staged, husky, eslint, prettier, commitlint for code consistency

- When type "git commit -m" => husky continue with "pre commit" action => lint-staged will find all file and run fix code and format with eslint and prettier => husky will reject/accept the commit => husky will run the "commit msg" for check message template with commitlint

| Note: If the .git folder in same with main folder, just "prepare": "husky"
